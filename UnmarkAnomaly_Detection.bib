  abstract = {Predicting the parameters of upcoming earthquakes has always been one of the most challenging topics in studies related to earthquake precursors. Increasing the number of sensors and satellites and consequently incrementing the number of observable possible earthquake precursors in different layers of the lithosphere, atmosphere, and ionosphere of the Earth has opened the possibility of using data fusion methods to estimate and predict earthquake parameters with low uncertainty. In this study, a Mamdani fuzzy inference system (FIS) was proposed and implemented in five case studies. In particular, the magnitude of Ecuador (16 April 2016), Iran (12 November 2017), Papua New Guinea (14 May 2019), Japan (13 February 2021), and Haiti (14 August 2021) earthquakes were estimated by FIS. The results showed that in most cases, the highest number of anomalies was usually observed in the period of about one month before the earthquake and the predicted magnitude of the earthquake in these periods was slightly different from the actual magnitude value. Therefore, based on the results of this study, it could be concluded that if a significant number of anomalies are observed in the time series of different precursors, it is likely that an earthquake of the magnitude predicted by the proposed FIS system within the Dobrovolsky area of the studied location will happen during the next month.},

  abstract = {On May 14, 2019, a strong Mw = 7.6 shallow earthquake occurred in Papua New Guinea. This paper explores for the first time the analysis of total electron content (TEC) products measured for 6~months by GPS antenna onboard Swarm satellites, to detect possible seismo-ionospheric anomalies around the time and location of the above-mentioned earthquake. The night-time vertical total electron content (VTEC) time series measured using Swarm satellites Alpha and Charlie, inside the earthquake Dobrovolsky's area show striking anomalies 31 and 35~days before the event. We successfully verified the possible presence of concomitant anomalous values of in situ electron density detected by the new Chinese satellite dedicated to search for electromagnetic earthquake precursors [China Seismo-Electromagnetic Satellite (CSES)-01]. On the other hand, the analysis of VTEC night time measured by Swarm Bravo shows gradual and abnormal increase of the VTEC parameter from about 23~days before the earthquake, which descends 3~days before the earthquake and reaches its lowest level around the earthquake day. We also analyzed the time series and tracks of other six in situ parameters measured by Swarm satellites, electron density from CSES, and also GPS-TEC measurements. As it is expected from the theory, the electron density anomalous variations acknowledge the Swarm VTEC anomalies, confirming that those anomalies are real and not an artifact of the analysis. The comparative analysis with measurements of other Swarm and CSES sensors emphasizes striking anomalies about 2.5~weeks before the event, with a clear pattern of the whole anomalies typical of a critical system as the earthquake process is for Earth. A confutation analysis outside the Dobrovolsky area and without significant seismicity shows no anomalies. Therefore based on our study, the VTEC products of Swarm satellites could be an appropriate precursor aside from the other measured plasma and magnetic parameters using Alpha, Bravo, and Charlie Swarm and CSES satellites that can be simultaneously analyzed to reduce the overall uncertainty.},

The data reveals a range of periodicities present in the radon time series. To identify seismic induced radon changes we treat the time series data through various filtering methods to remove inherent periodicities. The Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) is deployed to decompose the signal into its characteristic modes. Hilbert Huang Transform (HHT) is applied for the first time on the physically significant modes obtained by EEMD to represent time-energy-frequency of the recorded soil radon time series.

Furthermore, the prediction errors from the predictive models are used to indicate normal or abnormal behavior. An additional advantage of using the LSTM networks is that the earthquake precursor data can be directly fed into the network without any elaborate preprocessing as required by other approaches. Furthermore, no prior information on abnormal data is needed by these networks as they are trained only using normal data. Experiments using three groups of real data were conducted to compare the anomaly detection results of the proposed method with those of manual recognition. The comparison results indicated that the proposed LSTM network achieves promising results and is viable for detecting anomalies in earthquake precursor data.},

  abstract = {Offshore platforms are constantly exposed to dynamic forces by winds, waves, currents and earthquakes, which can easily lead to damage to the platforms during their serviceable lifetime. The real-time and continuous dynamic monitoring of offshore platforms in service plays an important role in reducing the risk of structural failure, instability and even destruction. In this study, a two-step approach was presented to capture the dynamic response of an offshore jacket platform based on the real-time kinematic global navigation satellite system (RTKGNSS), which combines a Chebyshev filter and complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (hereinafter referred to as CF-CEEMDAN). In the first step, the RTK-GNSS technique was employed to measure the dynamic displacements of the offshore platform under ambient excitations. Different from traditional accelerators, this technique has no unavoidable errors caused by double integration and directly measures the real-time and continuous dynamic displacements of the offshore platform at site. Next, a CF-CEEMDAN filter was developed to weaken the influence of the background noise in the RTK-GNSS signals. In the second step, the natural excitation technique and eigensystem realization algorithm (NExT-ERA) was applied to estimate the modal parameter (i.e. the first natural frequency) of the platform with filtered RTK-GNSS signals. In order to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed approach, a nonlinear signal with additive noise was firstly introduced to assess the effect of the CF-CEEMDAN method, and a finite element model of the platform was established to predict the natural frequency for comparison. The results prove that the CF-CEEMDAN filter not only has a better noise reduction effect than single CF or CEEMDAN method but also effectively improve the accuracy of RTK-GNSS technique to monitor the dynamic displacements of offshore platforms. Furthermore, the natural frequency obtained by experiment and NExT-ERA analysis is consistent with the predicted value based on finite element model.},

Here, taking advantage of measurements provided by the Swarm magnetic satellites, we investigate the possibility to detect some series of pre-earthquake magnetic anomalous signals, likely due to a lithosphere--atmosphere--ionosphere coupling, that can be a potential earthquake precursory pattern. Different techniques have been applied to Swarm data available during two months around earthquake occurrence. From the detected magnetic anomalies series (during night and magnetically quiet times or with an automatic detection algorithm), we show that the cumulative number of anomalies follows the same typical power-law behavior of a critical system approaching its critical time, and hence recovers as the typical recovery phase after a large event. The similarity of this behavior with the one obtained from seismic data analysis and the application of the analyses also to another period without significant seismicity do support a lithospheric-linked origin of the observed magnetic anomalies. We suggest that they might be connected to the preparation phase of the Nepal earthquake.},

  abstract = {During the late 1990s, Huang introduced the algorithm called Empirical Mode Decomposition, which is widely used today to recursively decompose a signal into different modes of unknown but separate spectral bands. EMD is known for limitations like sensitivity to noise and sampling. These limitations could only partially be addressed by more mathematical attempts to this decomposition problem, like synchrosqueezing, empirical wavelets or recursive variational decomposition. Here, we propose an entirely non-recursive variational mode decomposition model, where the modes are extracted concurrently. The model looks for an ensemble of modes and their respective center frequencies, such that the modes collectively reproduce the input signal, while each being smooth after demodulation into baseband. In Fourier domain, this corresponds to a narrow-band prior. We show important relations to Wiener filter denoising. Indeed, the proposed method is a generalization of the classic Wiener filter into multiple, adaptive bands. Our model provides a solution to the decomposition problem that is theoretically well founded and still easy to understand. The variational model is efficiently optimized using an alternating direction method of multipliers approach. Preliminary results show attractive performance with respect to existing mode decomposition models. In particular, our proposed model is much more robust to sampling and noise. Finally, we show promising practical decomposition results on a series of artificial and real data.},

  abstract = {A nonnegative tensor decomposition (NTD) approach has been developed to analyze the ionospheric magnetic field data of the Swarm Alpha and Charlie satellites for the Mw7.8 2015 Nepal earthquake. All available satellite data were analyzed regardless of geomagnetic activity. We used the amplitude time--frequency spectra of the two-satellite data to build third-order tensors and decomposed them into three components. One of these components seems to be more affected by seismicity. In particular, the cumulative number of anomalous tracks of this component displays accelerated growth that conforms to a sigmoid fit from 60 to 40 days before the mainshock. Subsequently, until ten days before the earthquake, it shows a weak accelerating trend that obeys a power-law behavior and then resumes linear growth after the mainshock. Moreover, the cumulative anomaly was indicated not to be caused by geomagnetic activity, solar activity, or other nonseismic factors. An investigation of the foreshocks around the epicenter reveals that the cumulative Benioff strain also exhibited two accelerated growths before the mainshock, which is consistent with the cumulative result of ionospheric anomalies. In the first acceleration stage, seismicity appeared in the region surrounding the epicenter, and most of the ionospheric anomalies were offset away from the epicenter. During the second acceleration stage, some foreshocks occurred closer to or on the mainshock fault, and ionospheric anomalies also appeared near two faults around the epicenter. Furthermore, the correspondence between the ionospheric anomalies and the anomalies in different geolayers can be explained by the lithosphere--atmosphere--ionosphere coupling model.},

Scheduled for launch in 2010, the mission will comprise a constellation of three satellites, with two spacecraft flying sideby- side at lower altitude (450 km initial altitude), thereby measuring the East-West gradient of the magnetic field, and the third one flying at higher altitude (530 km). High-precision and high-resolution measurements of the strength, direction and variation of the magnetic field, complemented by precise navigation, accelerometer and electric field measurements, will provide the necessary observations that are required to separate and model the various sources of the geomagnetic field. This results in a unique ``view'' inside the Earth from space to study the composition and processes of its interior. It also allows analysing the Sun's influence within the Earth system.

First in simulated real-time mode, we analyzed 1-5 Hz GPS data collected by 17 stations fully encircling the swarm zone at near-source distances up to about 40km using precise point positioning with ambiguity resolution (PPP-AR). We used a reference network of North American GPS stations well outside the region of deformation to estimate fractional-cycle biases and satellite clock parameters, which were then combined with ultrarapid orbits from the International GNSS Service to estimate positions during the Brawley seismic swarm. Next, we estimated seismogeodetic displacements and velocities from GPS phase and pseudorange observations and 100-200 Hz accelerations collected at three pairs of GPS and seismic stations in close proximity using a new tightly coupled Kalman filter approach as an extension of the PPP-AR process. We can clearly discern body waves in the velocity waveforms, including P-wave arrivals not detectable with the GPS-only approach for earthquake magnitudes as low as M-w 4.6 and significant static offsets for magnitudes as low as M-w 5.4. Our study shows that GPS networks upgraded with strong motion accelerometers can provide new information for improved understanding of the earthquake rupture process and be of critical value in creating a robust early warning system for any earthquake of societal significance.},

Near Iran-Iraq border earthquake, a rise of 4--6~\hspace{0pt}{$^\circ$}C from the normal temperature in both day and night Land Surface Temperature (LST) maps along the SW part of the fault is observed.

Further, Sentinel-1A microwave satellite data employing InSAR technique have been used to estimate co-seismic ground deformations and fault geometry and slip distribution of both earthquakes. The results show that both events occurred due to blind reverse fault mechanism dipping NE with shallow dip. The weightage of strike slip component and dip slip component is more or less equal to each other in total slip distribution for Iran-Iraq border earthquake. Similarly, New Mirpur, Pakistan earthquake have more strike slip components than dip slip components in the weightage in total slip distribution. Considerable number of aftershocks have also occurred in the regions as estimated by coulomb static stress along the SW side of the fault geometry of Iran-Iraq border earthquake and for New Mirpur, Pakistan earthquake, along the SSW, NW, and east side of the fault geometry. The correlation between high stress regions before and after the occurrence of earthquakes using thermal anomaly map and Coulomb static stress map has been also observed.},

We apply SSA to the time series data observed at closely spaced stations; Seikoshi (SKS), Mochikoshi (MCK), and Kamo (KAM) stations. Then, PCA is applied to the time series data sets filtered at 0.01 Hz of NS component at three stations. In order to remove the most intense signal like the first principal component, we make the differential data sets of SKS-MCK and MCK-KAM for the above data. The major findings are summarized as follows. (1) It is important to apply simultaneously SSA and PCA, because SSA gives the structure of signals and the number of sensors for PCA is estimated. This makes the results more convincing. (2) There is a significant advantage using PCA with differential data sets of filtered (0.01 Hz band) signal between SKS-KAM and MCK-KAM in NS component for removing the most intense signal like global variation (solar-terrestrial interaction). This yields that the anomalous changes in the second principal component were detected more clearly, and the contribution of the second principal component is found to be 20-40\%. It is enough to prove mathematical accuracy of the signal. Further application is required to accumulate events. These facts demonstrate a possibility of monitoring the crustal activity with using the SSA and PCA. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {It is a challenge to detect pre-seismic anomalies by using only one dataset due to the complexity of earthquakes. Therefore, it is a promising direction to use multiparameteric data. The earthquake cross partial multi-view data fusion approach (EQ-CPM) is proposed in this paper. By using this method, electromagnetic data and seismicity indicators are fused. This approach tolerates the absence of data and complements the missing part in fusion. First, the effectiveness of seismicity indicators and electromagnetic data was validated through two earthquake case studies. Then, four machine learning algorithms were applied to detect pre-seismic anomalies by using the fused data and two original datasets. The results show that the fused data provided better performance than the single-modal data. In the Matthews correlation coefficient index, the results of our method showed an 8\% improvement compared with the latest study.},

An augmented sparse state space model is first derived to represent the underlying governing equations of the system of interest with hysteresis nonlinearity. A Bayesian filter is then utilized to provide the displacement estimate under an earthquake excitation by fusing the identified sparse state space model with the measured system~ acceleration. To avoid subjective assumptions on the process and observation noises in the Bayesian filter, a double-loop process is proposed, where the inner loop is an online Bayesian filtering by the unscented Kalman filter with Robbins-Monro algorithm, while the outer loop is an offline Bayesian updating by the transitional Markov chain Monte Carlo method. The feasibility of the framework is demonstrated on a simple illustrative example and a followed engineering application to the state estimation of a bridge pier finite element model. The results indicate the capability of the framework to properly infer the system displacement, including its residual components.},

  abstract = {Outlier detection refers to the identification of data points that deviate from a general data distribution. Existing unsupervised approaches often suffer from high computational cost, complex hyperparameter tuning, and limited interpretability, especially when working with large, high-dimensional datasets. To address these issues, we present a simple yet effective algorithm called ECOD (Empirical-Cumulative-distribution-based Outlier Detection), which is inspired by the fact that outliers are often the "rare events" that appear in the tails of a distribution. In a nutshell, ECOD first estimates the underlying distribution of the input data in a nonparametric fashion by computing the empirical cumulative distribution per dimension of the data. ECOD then uses these empirical distributions to estimate tail probabilities per dimension for each data point. Finally, ECOD computes an outlier score of each data point by aggregating estimated tail probabilities across dimensions. Our contributions are as follows: (1) we propose a novel outlier detection method called ECOD, which is both parameter-free and easy to interpret; (2) we perform extensive experiments on 30 benchmark datasets, where we find that ECOD outperforms 11 state-of-the-art baselines in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and scalability; and (3) we release an easy-to-use and scalable (with distributed support) Python implementation for accessibility and reproducibility.},

  abstract = {In 98\,km SW of TresPicosin Mexico (15.022\,N, 93.899\,W, 47.40\,km depth) a powerful earthquake of Mw = 8.2 happened at 23:49:19 LT on September 07 (04:49:19 UTC on September 8), 2017. This paper presents the results of Swarm satellites (Alpha, Bravo and Charlie) data analysis around the Mexico earthquake epicenter during the period of 01 April to 15 October 2017. The visual inspection of the time series of 6 parameters measured using electric field instrument, absolute and vector field magnetometers on board each Swarm satellite shows a clear anomaly exactly on the earthquake day. Variations of the electron density and temperature, magnetic scalar and vectors (X, Y, Z) components exceed the limited bounds (M{\textpm}1.25{\texttimes}IQR) by several hundred percent. Analysis of the three satellites orbits inside Dobrovolsky's area on earthquake day acknowledges the detected anomalous variations. It should be noted that on earthquake day, the geomagnetic indices Dst, Kp and F10.7 have exceeded the allowed values and even reach the maximum values during the studied time period. Therefore it is difficult to acknowledge the seismicity nature of the detected anomalies on earthquake day. A very interest result is the detection of anomalies in different observables of ionosphere from about 130\,days before the earthquake. Since the Swarm is currently the only satellite mission that their data can be used to continuously monitor some of the important parameters of the ionosphere, therefore creating a monitoring system of ionosphere based on the Swarm data as an introduction to an earthquake warning system is proposed.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, the possibility that medium-large earthquakes could produce some electromagnetic ionospheric disturbances during their preparatory phase is controversial in the scientific community. Some previous works using satellite data from DEMETER, Swarm and, recently, CSES provided several pieces of evidence supporting the existence of such precursory phenomena in terms of single case studies and statical analyses. In this work, we applied a Worldwide Statistical Correlation approach to M5.5+ shallow earthquakes using the first 8 years of Swarm (i.e., from November 2013 to November 2021) magnetic field and electron density signals in order to improve the significance of previous statistical studies and provide some new results on how earthquake features could influence ionospheric electromagnetic disturbances. We implemented new methodologies based on the hypothesis that the anticipation time of anomalies of larger earthquakes is usually longer than that of anomalies of smaller magnitude. We also considered the signal's frequency to introduce a new identification criterion for the anomalies. We find that taking into account the frequency can improve the statistical significance (up to 25\% for magnetic data and up to 100\% for electron density). Furthermore, we noted that the frequency of the Swarm~magnetic field signal of possible precursor anomalies seems to slightly increase as the earthquake is approaching. Finally, we checked a possible relationship between the frequency of the detected anomalies and earthquake features. The earthquake focal mechanism seems to have a low or null influence on the frequency of the detected anomalies, while the epicenter location appears to play an important role. In fact, land earthquakes are more likely to be preceded by slower (lower frequency) magnetic field signals, whereas sea seismic events show a higher probability of being preceded by faster (higher frequency) magnetic field signals.},

A possible model to explain the phenomenology, based on the acoustic gravity waves and the ionosphere turbulence, is proposed. The method of diagnostics applied to this study has the advantage to be a global one due to the world wide location of the powerful VLF transmitters and of the satellite reception. However, a specific disadvantage exists because the method requires rather a long time period of analysis due to the large longitudinal displacements among the successive satellite orbits. At the moment, at least, one month seems to be necessary.},

A unique set of data obtained by the micro-satellite DEMETER (altitude of about 700 km, nearly Sun-synchronous orbit) and a robust two-step data processing has been used. In the first step, all the measured data are used to construct a map of electromagnetic emissions containing a statistical description of wave intensity at a given point of the satellite orbit under given conditions. In the second step, the intensity measured close to earthquakes is analyzed using the statistical distribution of background intensity obtained in the first step. The changes of wave intensity caused by seismic activity are investigated and their statistical significance is evaluated. Altogether, more than 2.5 years of satellite data have been analyzed and about 9000 earthquakes with magnitudes larger than or equal to 4.8 that occurred all over the world during the analyzed period have been included in the study. It is shown that, during the night, there is a statistically significant decrease by 4 - 6 dB of the measured wave intensity shortly (0-4 hours) before an intense surface (depth less than or equal to 40 km) earthquake.},

Although many methods have been proposed to highlight the edges of the subsurface structures, it is still the focus of many researchers to derive new techniques or enhance existing methods that can improve resolution within this scope. Here, we introduce an enhanced edge detection filter (FSED) based on a modified fast sigmoid function and the vertical and horizontal derivatives of the total horizontal gradient of the potential field data. The efficiency of the proposed filter was tested on synthetic data and the results were also compared with those obtained from other commonly used filters. The test results showed that the proposed filter could not only balance anomalies from shallow and deep sources, but also more accurately determine the edge location of these structures. The application of the proposed filter using real data was carried out on the gravity and magnetic data from Vietnam. For both the data, the FSED provided more detailed and clearer horizontal location of edges of causative structures. This filter is therefore promising to be a better tool for qualitative interpretation of potential field data compared to other popular filters.},

Earthquakes with magnitudes {$>$}4.8 were selected and classified according to their magnitudes, depths and locations (land, close to the coast, or below the sea). For each earthquake, an automatic search for ion density variations was conducted from 15 days before the earthquake, when the track of the satellite orbit was at less than 1,500 km from the earthquake epicenter. The result of this first step provided the variations relative to the background in the vicinity of the epicenter for each 15 days before each earthquake. In the second step, comparisons were carried out between the largest variations over the 15 days and the earthquake magnitudes. The statistical analysis is based on calculation of the median values as a function of the various seismic parameters (magnitude, depth, location). A comparison was also carried out with two other databases, where on the one hand, the locations of the epicenters were randomly modified, and on the other hand, the longitudes of the epicenters were shifted. The results show that the intensities of the ionospheric perturbations are larger prior to the earthquakes than prior to random events, and that the perturbations increase with the earthquake magnitudes.},

In order to exploit these measurements, an advanced ``comprehensive inversion'' (CI) algorithm has been developed to optimally separate the various major magnetic field sources in the near-Earth regime. The CI algorithm is used to determine Swarm Level-2 (L2) magnetic field data products that include the core, lithospheric, ionospheric, magnetospheric, and associated induced sources. In addition, it has become apparent that the CI is capable of extracting the magnetic signal associated with the oceanic principal lunar semidiurnal tidal constituent \$\$M\_2\$\$to such an extent that it has been added to the L2 data product line. This paper presents the parent model of the Swarm L2 CI products derived with measurements from the first 4~years of the Swarm mission and from ground observatories, denoted as ``CIY4,'' including the new product describing the magnetic signal of the \$\$M\_2\$\$oceanic tide.},

  abstract = {This paper focuses on the anomaly detection for ionospheric total electron content (TEC) before earthquakes. In this paper, a novel unsupervised approach is proposed. First, interval-based method is employed to granulate the TEC series. Justifiable granularity principle is utilized to construct interval information granules (IGs) for representing TEC series. Second, high-order difference method is introduced to construct rectangle IGs and cube IGs for obtaining the new representation of TEC. Third, corresponding similarity measurement method is designed to calculate the anomaly score of each IG, which is the evaluation criterion for detecting the anomalies. Finally, experimental results using real TEC datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Compared with the existing major approaches, because the proposed approach can capture more morphological details and variation trend of TEC series, it can achieve a higher detection accuracy.},

  abstract = {In this chapter, I proposed a real-time tsunami detection algorithm using Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD). EEMD adaptively decomposes a time series into a set of Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs). The tsunami signals of the Offshore Bottom Pressure Gauge (OBPG) can be automatically separated from the tidal components, seismic waves, and background noise. Unlike traditional tsunami detection methods, the new algorithm does not require tidal predictions. The application to the actual data of cabled OBPGs off the Tohoku coast showed that it successfully detected the tsunami from the 2016 Fukushima earthquake (M 7.4). The method was also applied to the extremely large tsunami from the 2011 Tohoku earthquake (M 9.0) and extremely small tsunami from the 1998 off Sanriku earthquake (M 6.4). The algorithm detected the former, which caused devastating damage, whereas it did not detect the latter micro tsunami, which was not noticed on the coast. The algorithm was also tested for a month-long OBPG data, and no false alarm occurred. Hence, the algorithm could detect tsunami arrival with a short detection delay and accurately characterize the tsunami amplitude.},

We proposed that: (1) a local PSO algorithm is employed to perform a global search,(2) a 1-D Probability Desity Function (PDF) is utilized to describe the local minimum in the full parameters space, which is automatically recognized as the initial model in the Simplex algorithm inversion. The PSO/Simplex integrated approach has been successfully applied to three different earthquakes: the 2003 Bam (Iran) earthquake (strike-slip), the 1998 Zhangbei (China) earthquake (dip-slip), and a simulated event with a normal fault with right-lateral slips. All the case studies sugguest the robustness and reliability of the integrated approach.},

In this paper, we explore 16 spot-checking classification algorithms, among which, the top classifier with low-frequency power spectra of electric and magnetic fields was used for ionospheric perturbation analysis. This study included the analysis of satellite data spanning over six years, during which about 8760 earthquakes with magnitude greater than or equal to 5.0 occurred in the world. We discover that among these methods, a gradient boosting-based method called LightGBM outperforms others and achieves superior performance in a five-fold cross-validation test on the benchmarking datasets, which shows a strong capability in discriminating electromagnetic pre-earthquake perturbations. The results show that the electromagnetic pre-earthquake data within a circular region with its center at the epicenter and its radius given by the Dobrovolsky's formula and the time window of about a few hours before shocks are much better at discriminating electromagnetic pre-earthquake perturbations. Moreover, by investigating different earthquake databases, we confirm that some low-frequency electric and magnetic fields' frequency bands are the dominant features for electromagnetic pre-earthquake perturbations identification. We have also found that the choice of the geographical region used to simulate the training set of non-seismic data influences, to a certain extent, the performance of the LightGBM model, by reducing its capability in discriminating electromagnetic pre-earthquake perturbations.},

The results show that: 1) There is a correlation between earthquakes of magnitude not less than 5.0 and ultra-low frequency disturbances in the electric field. The abnormal disturbance mainly occurred 11~days before the earthquake, 2~days before the earthquake to the day of the earthquake, and the location of the earthquake is within 200~km from the epicenter. 2) Sea earthquakes can observe more pre-seismic anomalous electromagnetic disturbances than land earthquakes. 3) In terms of earthquake magnitude, the larger the magnitude, the earlier the pre-earthquake anomalous disturbances appear and the wider the range of anomalies. This study provides an effective way to explain seismic ionospheric phenomena, and also provides a reference for the application of electromagnetic monitoring satellites in earthquake prediction and early warning as well as disaster prevention and mitigation.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a new multi-step prediction method of EMD-ELM (empirical mode decomposition extreme learning machine) to achieve the short-term prediction of strong earthquake ground motions. Firstly, the acceleration time histories of near-fault ground motions with nonstationary property are decomposed into several components of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) with different characteristic scales by the technique of EMD. Subsequently, the ELM method is utilized to predict the IMF components. Moreover, the predicted values of each IMF component are superimposed, and the short-term prediction of ground motions is attained with low error. The predicted results of near-fault acceleration records demonstrate that the EMD-ELM method can realize multi-step prediction of acceleration records with relatively high accuracy. Finally, the elastic and inelastic acceleration, velocity and displacement responses of single degree of freedom (SDOF) systems are also predicted with satisfactory accuracy by EMD-ELM method.

The goal was to investigate the physical mechanisms underlying electron and oxygen ion generation by evaluating the correlations between such anomalies and the seismic activity before the 6.4-magnitude earthquake in Yangbi, Yunnan, China, on 21 May 2021. Nine (75\%) of the twelve earthquakes that occurred during the study period and were not affected by magnetic storms were preceded by anomalous electron or oxygen ion densities of 1.1--4.5 {\texttimes} 1010/m3 and 2.8--6.0 {\texttimes} 1010/m3, respectively. The anomalies were generally observed within the two weeks preceding the earthquakes and were associated with most strike-slip and thrust earthquakes, which were mainly located on the southeastern and northwestern edges of the Tibetan Plateau---but not normal fault earthquakes. The anomalies were likely the result of acoustic-gravity waves generated by slow vibrations of the Earth's surface reaching the ionosphere, where they cause oscillations in ionospheric electron and ion densities. In addition, the association between ionospheric anomalies and strong earthquakes was confirmed by the observation of other atmospheric anomalies before the Yangbi earthquake.},

  abstract = {The identification of magnetic, electric and electromagnetic (EM) precursory signals related to volcanic activities and earthquakes is still a matter of debate. Some examples are now well established, but they are often based on a few parameters recorded on sparse equipments and with no multi-disciplinary approach. Demeter program takes into account a more complete approach of EM phenomena related to volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, by combining both ground-based and satellite EM monitoring, from direct current to several kilohertz, i.e. from ULF, ELF to VLF frequency domains. The research program stands in two parts: one is the identification of EM signals at the satellite altitude and the other consists in detailed studies in a few pilot sites on the ground. Two main test sites have been considered: La Fournaise volcano in R{\'e}union Island and the seismogenic Corinth rift in Greece. Both sites allow for performing EM studies in a multi-disciplinary environment. La Fournaise volcano erupts on average two times a year. The self-recording Demeter EM station is composed of three modules measuring the components of the magnetic and electric fields in three different frequency domains: DC to 0.5Hz, 0.0033--160Hz and 8--10kHz. Preliminary observations made during the May 2003 eruption show that electric and magnetic signals appeared before the eruption. Some signals present sharp step-like variations, with amplitudes up to several hundreds mV per km and a few hour duration, followed by periods with a higher spectral frequency content. The frequency of these signals can be of several tens of Hz. The Corinth rift is a highly seismic area, frequently affected by seismic swarms. In 2004 the region has experienced tens of earthquakes of magnitude less than 4.6. A Demeter station has been set up on the Trizonia Island along the northern mainland coast, where a 30km long seismic gap has been identified. The station is composed of two modules recording the three components of the magnetic field and the two horizontal components of the electric field in the ULF and ELF--VLF frequency bands. The audiomagnetotelluric soundings show that the station is close to a regional conductive fault connected to the sea. The first 4 months of observation clearly show that 29 earthquakes, even of low magnitude (M⩾2.8), occurring at less than 140km of distance of the station, have generated electric signals when the seismic waves have passed the EM station. For a given magnitude of the earthquake, the energy of the electric signal is independent of the distance between the focal source and the EM station, which points out local electric source mechanisms. The greater the magnitude of the earthquake, the greater is the energy of the electric signal is. The co-seismic electric signals have the same morphology as that of the passing seismic wave, and there is no noticeable time delay between the electric and the seismic signals. This simultaneity between the seismic and the electric signal is best explained by the generation of an electrokinetic effect due to the passage of the seismic wave through the seawater-saturated ground.},
